# LEGO Brick Detector and Placement Verification using YOLOv5

## Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect and recognize various LEGO brick types within images. Additionally, it implements a live brick placement verification system based on the trained model.

## Features
- **Data Curation:** Curated a diverse dataset comprising images with different backgrounds and variations in brick placement. The dataset includes 20 types of LEGO bricks, exhibiting various colors, sizes, and placements.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, zooming in/out to enrich the dataset and improve model robustness.
- **Model Training:** Trained the YOLOv5 model for 50 epochs using the curated dataset.
- **Brick Placement Game:** Developed a feature where users can place bricks on a board, and the model detects the placement. It provides placement verification by comparing with previous placements.

## Usage
1. **Model Deployment:** Instructions on how to deploy the trained YOLOv5 model.
2. **Running the Game:** Guidance on how to interact with the brick placement game, including adding bricks and using the detection functionality.

## Requirements
- YOLOv5
- Python

## Training Details
- **Model:** YOLOv5
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
